# Astro virtual assistant

Astro is a virtual assistant for console.redhat.com. We are currently migrating away from [Rasa](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/).
If you would like to see the legacy code head over to the [astro-virtual-assistant](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/astro-virtual-assistant/tree/main).

See more information on our [documentation](./docs/index)
